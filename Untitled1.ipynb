            "\n",
            "Let's be honest, my initial foray into meal prepping resembled this chubby little shark.  Overwhelmed, unprepared, and probably a little bit sad.  I envisioned perfectly portioned containers of healthy goodness, but reality hit like a tidal wave of leftover pasta and rogue avocado.  My first attempt looked less like a fitness plan and more like a feast fit for a Great White – a Great White who'd given up on the whole ocean thing and opted for a sedentary lifestyle on the beach.\n",
            "\n",
            "The photo above, a hilarious meme featuring a supremely rotund shark (I felt personally attacked!), perfectly captures my early struggles.  I went from one extreme – barely eating anything – to the other – making massive portions that never got eaten.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then, something shifted. I stopped thinking of meal prepping as this monumental, all-or-nothing task.  Instead, I broke it down. I started small, focusing on just one or two meals a week.  I experimented with recipes, learning what I actually enjoyed and what wasn't worth the effort.  I embraced leftovers – cleverly repurposing them into new dishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, my meal prep looks nothing like that sad, beach-bound shark. My containers are filled with colorful, balanced meals that fuel my day. I finally found a rhythm, a system that works for *my* life.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, to all those who are starting their meal prep journey, my advice is this: start small, be patient, and don't be afraid to laugh at your mistakes (or your overly-ambitious portion sizes!).  Your \"shark-sized\" portions can shrink, and the journey to healthy eating can be surprisingly rewarding.  And hey, at least you won't end up looking like a chubby, beach bum shark.\n",
